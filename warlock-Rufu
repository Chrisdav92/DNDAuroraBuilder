      <p>Starting at 1st level, you gain the ability to place a baleful curse on someone. As a bonus action, choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The target is cursed for 1 minute. The curse ends early if the target dies, you die, or you are incapacitated. Until the curse ends, you gain the following benefits:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>You gain a bonus to damage rolls against the cursed target. The bonus equals your proficiency bonus.</li>
        <li>Any attack roll you make against the cursed target is a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 on the d20.</li>
        <li>If the cursed target dies, you regain hit points equal to your warlock level + your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1 hit point).</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="indent">You can’t use this feature again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
