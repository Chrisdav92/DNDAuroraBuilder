      <p> Starting at first level you gain the service of a hound, sent by Rufu to watch over you. The soul takes the form and stats of a dog. It over your commands which you can give telepathically up to 100 ft away. It has two forms, which depend on your bodys current form. You gain the following benefits:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>While your body is still intact, the canine reverts to a puppy form. In this form the puppy doesn't have normal Death Hound stats (basically cat stats). It shares your square, and you gain blindsense(30 ft). In addition you gain a bonus to your passive Perception, and Perception rolls equal to your Charisma modifier.</li>
        <li>You can see through the dogs eyes and hear what it hears while it is within 100 feet of you.</li>
        <li>The Hound doesn’t require sleep. While it is within 100 feet of you, it can awaken you from sleep as a bonus action.
        </li>
        <li>While perched on your shoulder, the pup can’t be targeted by any attack or other harmful effect; only you can cast spells on it; it can’t take damage; and it is incapacitated. This effect goes away if the pup is not on your person, or if your body fails, in which it turns into the Death Hound as described below. 
        </li>
        <li>If you are slain by a creature, the dog gains advantage on all attack rolls against the killer for the next 24 hours (this effect also occurs should the puppy die and you still live), and turns into The Death Hound. As the Death Hound, the puppy transforms into a hound of Rufu. It retains the stats of a dire wolf with abilites that grow over leveling. In combat, you roll initiative for the Hound and control how it acts. 
        </li>
        <li>The hound vanishes when it dies, or if the two of you are separated by more than 5 miles. At the end of a short or long rest, you can call the dog back to you—no matter where it is or whether it died—and it reappears within 5 feet of you.
        </li>
        
      </ul>
      <p class="indent">You can’t call the dog again until you finish a short or long rest, if it has died.</p>
